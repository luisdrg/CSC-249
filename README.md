# Hi, I'm Luis 👋

## About Me

CS grad who likes building useful/weird tools, learning new tech, and figuring things out as I go. I enjoy taking an idea from “that would be cool” to something that actually runs.

## My Foo 🎯

I get into projects (mostly unfinished) that mix tech with everyday stuff: fantasy esports, music tools, alert systems, and apps that help people do something faster or smarter. I like when software feels practical but also fun.

## Currently Learning

* 🤖 ASP.NET for backend
* 🐙 GitHub workflows & version control
* 🧩 Full-stack app structure & data modeling
* ⚡ Real-time events, scraping & automation

## Fun Facts
* I am a little anti-AI. It's one of the first settings I disable from my IDE. However, I find it useful for to format READMEs and helping me debug. 
* I once made a bot that alerts people about drops before they sell out. It started as a random idea and turned into an actual tool that people use.
